            COVID-19 has shifted the educational landscape. Schools and Parents will benefit from a new form of partnership this is where EduNoggle will come in to support all community members.
                    
                     Every child needs a champion and I was fortunate to have 2 cheerleaders. Now it is my turn to share what I have learned on this journey. 
                      
                        The tools you will find in EduNoggle will provide you insight to be the champion for your student children and community. 
                         
                            Yes, the gift of lifelong learning will be supported with the various tools in the subscription to EduNoggle. As part of the subscription, a family will have various access to Pk -12 learning tools. 
                            
                                We also provide 1:1 services for families who need support in advocating for students who have diverse learning needs. 
                            
                                     Besides, we offer consultation for school districts that need a thought partner to ensure all students will have learning opportunities with the focus of inclusion for all learners. 
                            
                                        COVID-19 has accelerated the importance of student independence to the earlier grades. Let's go on this journey together!
